What classes/entities do we need to model?
  We need to store student and class information.  We also need to store students' grades for each class.

What fields/attributes will each entity need?
  At the very least, each student will need a first and last name in the system.  I assumed that contact information would also be useful so included phone number, email, and address as well.

  As far as classes go, each class must have a name at the very least.  I left it at this since we do not know if there are multiple sections or times or if it is a continuous self-paced online course.  We would also need to know which students were taking each class and what their grades are.

What data types do we need to use?
  Strings are used for most of the student data with the exception of the phone number which is an integer.  For the class data, strings are also used

What relationships exist between entities?
  There is a relationship between each student in the student table and the students in the classes table.  We have many students with each of them being able to take multiple classes.

How should those relationships be represented in tables?
  The relationship would best be represented using a foreign key connecting the student's id to the student column in the class table.



Students Table:
  id - primary key, integer
  first_name - text
  last_name - text
  phone - numeric[10]
  email - text
  address - text

Classes Table:
  id - primary key, integer
  student_id - foreign key pointing to students.id, integer
  class_name - text
  grade - char




1. SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name
FROM classes
JOIN students
ON classes.student_id=students.id
WHERE class_name='Math1';

2. SELECT COUNT(student_id), grade
FROM classes
WHERE class_name='Math1'
GROUP BY grade
ORDER BY grade asc;

3. SELECT COUNT(student_id), class_name
FROM classes
GROUP BY class_name
ORDER BY COUNT desc;

4. SELECT class_name
FROM classes
GROUP BY class_name
ORDER BY COUNT(student_id) desc
LIMIT 1;
